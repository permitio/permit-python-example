The app demonstrate a design collaboration app

  ```
  PERMIT_API_KEY=<API_KEY_HERE>
  CONNECTION_STRING=<CONNECTION_STRING>
  ```
 - run ``` docker-compose up -d ``` (deploy the pdp, the db ,and the app)

 ## Use The App
 Now it all setup to use our design app!

 open [swagger](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

 - Signup a new user with the email **reader@gmail.com** using the [sign up request](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/auth/create_user_route_auth_signup__post)

- paste it to the request body 
   ```
  {   
    "user":"reader@gmail.com",
    "role": "reader"
  }
    ```

 ### Lets try to create new design when we signed as reader 
 - Signin (In the swagger page press on the authorized button and paste the user email)
 - Try to create design using the [create design request](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/design/create_design_design_post)
 #### We get an 403 status with the message Not authorized üîí

 ### Now Lets create new user but now with **creator** permissions
