# Permit Python With FastAPI Example


The app demonstrate a design collaboration app
for users to share designs(like figma) and comment on them. the app policy will be enforce by permit. there are 3 types of users.
viewer, editor, and admin.

- **Viewer** can only view design and comments on design, he can delete and edit his own comments.

TF_VAR_permit_api_key=<API_KEY_HERE>
```
- Load the variables into your shell
```

```
- Applying terraform plan
```
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
```
- write yes in the command line and press enter

go to your project dashboard you should see your policies resources and roles 


## Launch FastAPI App
 - Deploy to your docker enviorment db(postgres)and the pdp
 - Create the schema for your app via alembic
 - Create venv enviorment and activate it
 - Run the web server with the command ``` uvicorn app.main:app --reload ```

 ## Use The App
 Now it all setup to use our design app!

 - Signup  new user
 - Signin (get fake jwt for the demonstration)
 - use the set_role route and add add to the user a creator role.
 - use the create_design route and pass the user details
 - use the create_comment route and create comment on that    design
 - Signup  new user
 - Signin (get fake jwt for the demonstration)
 - use the set_role route and add to the user a viewer role.
 - try to delete the design of user CreatorUser with the email of ViewerUser - it should be rejected.
